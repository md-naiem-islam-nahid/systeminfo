# System Info Viewer

This is a fun project that I created to monitor RAM and CPU usage using Node.js. This project was inspired by a friend who wanted to keep track of system resources. 

## Project Overview

The main focus of this project is the backend, so the frontend is quite basic. The application provides real-time data about the system's RAM and CPU usage.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**: Use `git clone https://github.com/md-naiem-islam-nahid/systeminfo` to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use `cd systeminfo` to navigate to the project directory.

3. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.

4. **Start the server**: Run `npm start` to start the server.

The server will start on port 4569 of localhost.

## Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, you can access the application by going to `http://localhost:4569` in your web browser. You should be able to see real-time data about your system's RAM and CPU usage.

## Contributing
